# Infected
An Infected game for infected people. Done! I like it. I was about to give up on this project, but I told myself don't.
I was going to give up, but I kept pushing through it. I love how this game came out!
One of my best piece of work!

You may need to install SFML and do all the linking itself.
I will looking into more ways to use this.
Right now, I'll like the stuff with the .dll files
I heard that there was another way and I will give that a shot on my next game I use for SFML.

Infect everybody and get them sick.
Not with just one virus, but most of them!
Infect these people and win!
